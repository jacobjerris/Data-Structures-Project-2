# Data-Structures-Project-2
In this project we took parts of our first project but incorporated two new classes. 
<h3>Stack Class</h3>
<p>In this class we made different methods that allowed us to push items onto a stack, as well as pop them off if needed. We also incorporated methods to check if the stack was full, or if it was empty. Which came in handy when pushing objects from the Queue onto the final stack.</p>
